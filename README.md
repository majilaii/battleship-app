TODO: Multiplayer implementation:

A multiplayer implementation can be done using Socket.io to enable real time communication. This will allow the server to respond to each player whether their grid was hit or not by the other player.
The frontend can then listen to the socket's response and update the grid accordingly. If a gameover signal is sent, the frontend then renders the gameover screen and the game is done.
So far, the backend classes may need some adjustments to accommodate multiplayer but for the most part, it will be quite similar. Each player will enter a room generated by the socket. Each player will send their ships to the server and place them manually. If both has sent valid ship placements, the game can begin and each player takes turn shooting each other's board using the shoot method.
