# Multiplayer implementation:

A multiplayer implementation can be done using Socket.io to enable real-time communication between the clients (players) and the server. This will allow the server to notify each player about the opponent's moves and whether their grid was hit or not. The frontend can then listen to the socket's events and update the grid accordingly. If a 'gameover' event is received, the frontend renders the gameover screen and the game ends.

The existing backend classes may need some adjustments to accommodate multiplayer, but for the most part, the game logic will be quite similar. Here's an outline of the proposed multiplayer flow:

```
1. Each player enters a room generated by the server using Socket.io (For searching, a simple array structure is only needed. If the array is filled with two people, we simply put these two players into a room, and start the game)
2. Both players send their ship placements to the server and place them manually on their respective grids.
3. The server validates the ship placements for both players.
4. If both players have sent valid ship placements, the game begins, and the server determines which player goes first.
5. Players take turns shooting at each other's boards by sending their moves to the server.
6. The server processes the moves, updates the game state, and sends the results back to both players using Socket.io events.
7. The frontend listens for these events and updates the grids accordingly.

```
